# Resonant Wireless Power Transfer â€“ MATLAB Simulation & Analysis

This project models and simulates a wireless power transfer (WPT) system using LC resonance principles. Developed as a hands-on study of how resonance tuning and coil distance affect power transfer efficiency, this project combines theory, simulation, and physical circuit insights.

## Features

- **Resonant Frequency Calculation**
  - Based on circuit parameters:  
**f = 1 / (2Ï€âˆš(LC))**


- **Frequency Response Analysis**
  - Output voltage and phase plotted across a frequency sweep from 60 kHz to 300 kHz
  - Confirms resonance near 159.16 kHz with minimal percent error

- **Efficiency vs. Coil Distance**
  - Simulated using a simplified exponential decay model for coupling coefficient \( k \)
  - Power transfer efficiency plotted over distances from 2 cm to 10 cm

- **Time-Domain Waveform Simulation**
  - Sinusoidal transmitter and received voltage signals plotted to show energy transfer dynamics
  - Observes attenuation and phase lag in the receiver waveform
